# 📖 News Web App

## 🛠️ Project Overview
The **News Web App** is a responsive web application built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** that allows users to fetch the latest news articles based on their queries. By leveraging the powerful [News API](https://newsapi.org), the application retrieves articles from various sources, ensuring users are always informed about current events. The intuitive and clean interface enhances the user experience, making it easy to find and read news articles.

## 🎉 Features
- **Responsive Design:** Automatically adjusts to various screen sizes for optimal viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic News Fetching:** Users can search for articles by entering keywords, which the app retrieves in real time from the News API.
- **User-Friendly Display:** Articles are presented with images, titles, and descriptions for easy browsing and comprehension.

## 🌐 Key Functionality
- **Search Functionality:** Enter keywords to fetch related news articles from a variety of sources.
- **Clean UI:** The articles are displayed in an organized manner, featuring headlines, images, and summaries.

## 🔗 How to Access
Deploy this project on GitHub and host it on platforms like **Heroku** or **Render** for easy access via a web browser.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Open your terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```  
   Replace `[repository-url]` with the URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to the project directory and run:  
   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]  
   npm install
   ```  
   Note: The `node_modules` folder may be too large (over 25 MB) to be included in your GitHub repository, so you need to install it using `npm install`.

3. **Run the Server:**  
   Start the server by executing:  
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```  
   Your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware management.
- **Fetch API:** Used for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- **News API:** Provides access to news articles from various sources.

## 🛡️ API Key
- To utilize the News API, you need to include your API key. **Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `server.js` file with your actual API key**:  
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch(`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${query}&apiKey=YOUR_API_KEY`);
  ```

## 💡 Notes
- Ensure to keep your API key secure and do not expose it publicly in your codebase.
- Consider implementing error handling in your application to manage potential issues gracefully.
